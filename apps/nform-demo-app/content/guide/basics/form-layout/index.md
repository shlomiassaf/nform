# Form Layout

The form layout describes how the form controls within the forms flow.  

For example, we can create a form with all controls rendering one after the other, **Horizontally**:

<div pbl-example-view="pbl-horizontal-form-layout-example"></div>

**Vertically**:

<div pbl-example-view="pbl-vertical-form-layout-example"></div>

Or, using **flex box**, allowing complex grid like capabilities.  
In the following example, a responsive 3-column layout design, using flex box via angular [flex-layout library](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout)

<div pbl-example-view="pbl-flex-form-layout-example"></div>

There are a lot of ways to control the layout:

- Using CSS Classes
- Using Template Overrides
- Using Renderers

In this chapter we will focus on layout using **Template Override** and how we declare `pbl-nform` can help us control the layout.

I> **Using CSS Classes** will work but it is more complex to reason about, especially with angular's view encapsulation. We will not discuss it in the tutorial.

I> **Using Renderers** is an advanced scenario, discussed later in the guide.  
In the examples above you might have noticed repetitive code use when creating template overrides, this is where **renderers** come into play.

## Declaring `pbl-nform`

There are 2 style we can declare the `NFormComponent` component:

1. `<pbl-nform></pbl-nform>`
2. `<form pbl-nform></form>`

In the **1st** declaration style we let the component control and manage the `form` element, resulting in the following rendered structure:

```html
<pbl-nform [model]="model">
  <form>
    <!-- FORM COMPONENTS... -->
  </form>
</pbl-nform
```

We used this in the first example (horizontal).

While this declaration style is fine for most simple to moderate scenarios, in complex scenarios you will want to control the element warping the controls.  
Because `<form>` is rendered by the internal template of `pbl-nform` it is hard to control and style it directly, to do so we will need to use CSS classes and / or renderers.

In the **2st** declaration style we control and manage the `form` element, resulting in the following rendered structure:

```html
<form pbl-nform [model]="model">
  <!-- FORM COMPONENTS... -->
</form>
```

With this declaration style we have full control over the form controls and over their direct parent, this is what allowed us to use flex-box directives
directly on the flex container and on the flex items directly (via template overrides).

I> Because we are declaring the `form` directly in our component, angular's view encapsulation is not an issue. This is also true for form-control's if we use template overrides.

## Creating meta driven layout

We've covered the basic approach of how to layout your form, this is the core technique used to create complex layout.  
Using other tools offered by the library you can design a powerful meta-driven layout system.

For example, by adding a `flex` property to the `data` object of each form property we can allow static declaration of our layout without using code.

```typescript
@FormModel()
export class Hero {
  @FormProp({
    vType: 'text',
    data: {
      flex: '0 1 65%',
    },
  })
  name: string;

  @FormProp({
    vType: 'boolean',
    data: {
      flex: '0 1 35%',
    },
  })
  superHero: boolean;
}
```

And in a custom template override:

```html
  <div *nFormOverride="'*'; let ctx" style="flex: {{ ctx.item.data?.flex }}">
    <material-form-control-renderer [nFormCmp]="nForm"
                                    [nForm]="ctx.nForm"
                                    [fArray]="ctx.fArray"
                                    [fControl]="ctx.fControl"
                                    [fGroup]="ctx.fGroup"
                                    [item]="ctx.item"></material-form-control-renderer>
  </div>
```

As previously mentioned, with **renderers** this can be fully automated, scoped and encapsulated, without the need of custom template overrides. (think plugin, addon, mini library)

## Control Rendering Order

The entire layout methods we've covered allow us to control the space a control will take but not the position.  
The layout is declared by templates, we use templates to define a container that renders a control but when, where and
in what order are they rendered?

**nForm** controls the rendering of components and it does that in the order defined in the metadata.  
If order is not explicitly defined, the default order is the order of the properties defined on the class (top to bottom).

To define the order, use the `ordinal` property provided in `FormPropMetadataArgs`.

```typescript
@FormModel()
export class Hero {
  @FormProp({
    vType: 'number',
  })
  id: number;                         // I Will be third, i'm unordered but i'm the first unordered!!!

  @FormProp({
    ordinal: 1,                        // I Will be second!!!
    vType: 'text',
  })
  name: string;

  @FormProp({
    ordinal: 0,                        // I Will be first!!!
    vType: 'date',
  })
  birth: string;

  @FormProp({
    vType: 'boolean',
  })
  hasTracking: boolean;

  @FormProp({
    vType: 'slideToggle',
  })
  doubleAgent: boolean;
}
```

In the example above, the rendering order of the controls will be:

- birth
- name
- id
- hasTracking
- doubleAgent

I> Unordered controls are always set AFTER ordered controls, if there are multiple unordered controls their order is based on the order their respective
properties were defined on the class.

## Breaking the Layout

**nForm** will render controls one after the other, in the order they are defined, can we break it?

Yes, we can break the layout and we should do it if:

- We want to position control in an arbitrary order inside the form
- We need a complex layout, with internal structures (i.e. flex with nested columns/rows).
